### Method:

1. Combine all dry ingredients except Vitamin D. Mix well.
2. Measure olive oil into a separate container.
3. To prepare an individual meal, measure about a third of the dry mix and a third of the oil into a large drinking vessel.
4. Add 400-500 ml (14-16 oz) of water, and shake or stir well.
5. Chill for several hours if possible, to improve taste and texture. It may be healthier that way too (due to phytic acid deactivation).
6. Meanwhile, take your Vitamin D and/or get some sunshine.
7. Drink.
